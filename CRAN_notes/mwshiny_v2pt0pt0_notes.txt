## Resubmission
This is a version update (2.0.0). In this version, I have:
- condensed win_titles and ui_win such that the named list ui_win now contains window titles
- fixed necessity for stated dependencies and have therefore removed the argument from mwsApp()
- updated vignettes accordingly
- added link to mwshiny-example GitHub repo to one vignette
- removed the htmltools dependency, as it's no longer needed
