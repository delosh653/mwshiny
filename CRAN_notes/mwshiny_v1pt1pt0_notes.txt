## Resubmission
This is a version update (1.1.0). In this version, I have:
- updated both the serv_out and serv_calc functions to be of the form function(calc, sess), where sess is the traditional Shiny session variable.
- added more safeguards regarding spaces in window names and nonunique window names
- updated and added some clarifications to vignettes accordingly
