## Resubmission
This is a version update (1.0.0). In this version, I have:
- updated mwsApp() to accept dependencies from imported packages that are heavily dependent on CSS and JS files
- added a vignette explaining this functionality
- updated mwshiny vignette to reflect changes
- updated the required functions for the serv_calc and serv_out lists to only require one parameter
  - this parameter, calc, now includes both traditional shiny input and any calculated values derived from input
- all body tags in submitted page HTML will be changed to div, with a warning; submitted html tags throw an error
- added a required import, and several suggested imports
